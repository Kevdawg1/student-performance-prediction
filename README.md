<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to showcase an end-to-end ML algorithm implementation and ETL and CI/CD pipelines, aligning with industry standards of an MLOps infrastructure. The project include a complete pipeline of data ingestion, data transformation, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and Docker container publishing for deployment in Microsoft Azure DevOps. 

The training data is extracted from a web source and loaded into the project directory directly. A data transformation pipeline is then applied using a combination of `ColumnTransformer`, `SimpleImputer`, `OneHotEncoder`, and `StandardScaler` to preprocess the training and testing data. 

The project trains several different models such as: 

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* AdaBoost Regressor
* XGBRegressor
* KNN

Using GridSearch, hyperparameter tuning is applied to identify the best performing model with the best set of hyperparameters. 

When the model is trained and saved into the project's artifacts, the project is exported as a private Docker Image which is pushed into Azure Container Registry using Docker CLI commands. 

The project also comes with custom logging and exception handling to efficiently improve troubleshooting in the app.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* python
  ```sh
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
* Ollama - Linux
  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ```
* Ollama - macOS and Windows: https://ollama.com/download
* Slack: https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/downloads
* Slack API: https://api.slack.com/apps

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kevdawg1/student-performance-prediction.git
   ```
2. Create virtual environment
   ```sh
   conda create -p venv python==3.11
   ```
3. Install requirements
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure environment variables in a .env file
   ```
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxp-********"
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET="********"
   DEEPSEEK_API_URL="http://localhost:11434/api/chat"
   BOT_USER_ID="U0*******"
   CHANNEL_ID="C0*******""
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

### Set up Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry will be used to containerize the Docker Image of the project. 

1. Log in or sign up for a Microsoft Azure account.
2. Create an Azure Container Registry with the following details:
    * Registry Name: ensure that the registry name matches the domain of the Docker Image i.e. testdockerkevin
    * Location: select the closest region to your physical location
    * SKU: Standard
3. Once created, navigate to Settings > Access Keys > Admin User: Enabled.
    * Copy and paste the password in a secure location for later use

### Build and Push Docker Image to Azure Container Registry

Run the following commands from your terminal at the project root directory: 

** Replace `testdockerkevin` with your Azure Container Registry name.

```
docker build -t testdockerkevin.azurecr.io/mltest:latest .
```
```
docker login testdockerkevin.azurecr.io
```

Username: Your Azure Container Registry name

Password: Use the password you copied from the previous step. 

```
docker push testdockerkevin.azurecr.io/mltest:latest
```

### Create Azure Web App

1. In Azure App Services, create a web application. 
2. Ensure that the Resource Group is shared with the Container Registry created previously. 
3. Publish: select `Docker Container`
4. Region: select the closest region to your physical location
5. Pricing Plan: select a Free Tier plan if available
6. Under `Docker` settings, configure the following settings: 
    * Options: `Single Container`
    * Image Source: `Azure Container Registry`
    * Registry: select your container registry
    * Image: select the Docker image that was pushed previously
    * Tag: `latest`
7. Create the Web App.
8. Navigate to `Deployment Center`, enable Continuous Deployment.
9. Change the `Source` to `GitHub Actions: Build, deploy and manage your container app automatically with GitHub Actions`.
10. Under the GitHub Actions section, configure the following settings: 
    * Organization: select the relevant GitHub organization your project repository is under.
    * Repository: select your project repository.
    * Branch: main
11. Save your changes.
